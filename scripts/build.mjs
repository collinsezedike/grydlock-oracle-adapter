/**
 * Dual-module build (issue #96).
 *
 * Bundles `src/index.ts` into a single-file ESM output and a single-file
 * CommonJS output with esbuild, then runs `tsc --emitDeclarationOnly` for
 * the `.d.ts` files.
 *
 * Bundling to one file per format, rather than emitting one compiled file
 * per source module (plain `tsc`), sidesteps a real interop problem: this
 * package's relative imports (`from './RiskOracle'`) have no file
 * extension, which is fine for `tsc`'s own module resolution but is not
 * valid under Node's ESM loader, which requires extensions on relative
 * specifiers. Bundling inlines every relative import, so the emitted ESM
 * file never needs Node to resolve one. `"sideEffects": false` in
 * package.json still lets a downstream bundler tree-shake unused named
 * exports out of the single bundled file — bundling to one file does not by
 * itself defeat tree-shaking; see scripts/bundle-size.mjs, which verifies
 * this for the "StubOracle only" import pattern.
 *
 * Type declarations are emitted separately, per source module, by `tsc`
 * (not esbuild, which does not generate types). Declaration files are
 * resolved by the TypeScript compiler/language server using tsconfig's own
 * module resolution, not Node's runtime ESM loader, so their
 * extension-less relative imports are not subject to the same restriction
 * and do not need bundling.
