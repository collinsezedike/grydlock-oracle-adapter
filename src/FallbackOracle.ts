/**
 * Tries multiple oracles in priority order until one succeeds, choosing that order fresh on
 * every call with a non-stationary multi-armed bandit over each tier's recent success rate.
 *
 * ## Why a bandit, and why discounting
 *
 * A fixed cooldown after N failures implicitly assumes tier health is binary and slow-changing.
 * Real tier failure rates drift continuously, so this class treats each tier as a bandit arm and
 * runs discounted UCB (Garivier & Moulines, "On Upper-Confidence Bound Policies for Non-Stationary
 * Bandit Problems"): every call, every tier's belief decays by `discountFactor`, then the tier
 * actually pulled gets its observation added. This was chosen over the two other standard
 * non-stationarity mechanisms:
 *
 * - **Sliding-window UCB** (only the last W observations count) needs W chosen to roughly match
 *   the drift speed: too small and estimates are noisy, too large and it reacts too slowly to a
 *   real step change. Discounting has no such per-drift-speed knob — the same `discountFactor`
 *   adapts to both abrupt and gradual drift because it downweights continuously rather than
 *   truncating at a hard boundary.
 * - **Change-point detection** (e.g. CUSUM) requires a detection threshold that trades false
 *   positives (thrashing on noise) against false negatives (missing a real shift), and a full
 *   belief reset on trigger throws away potentially-still-useful history about *other* tiers.
 *   Discounting degrades gracefully instead of resetting.
 * - Discounting is also O(1) memory per tier (two running numbers), vs. O(W) for a window.
 *
 * ## Reconciling with CircuitBreakerOracle
 *
 * `CircuitBreakerOracle` is treated as a correct black box: this class never inspects or
 * replicates its threshold/cooldown state machine. It only reads the *public* `getState()` a
 * chain member may expose. When a tier's state is `OPEN` at the moment it's tried, the call still
 * happens (so the breaker's own HALF_OPEN probing continues to work untouched) — but the
 * bandit's belief is **not** updated from that call's outcome. An OPEN breaker fast-fails from
 * state it already holds; feeding that into the bandit would be re-observing the same verdict
 * the breaker recorded when it first tripped, not new evidence, and would pin the tier's
 * discounted failure rate near 100% long after it may have actually recovered (a real HALF_OPEN
 * probe only updates the bandit once the breaker itself has moved off OPEN). A tier that is
 * CLOSED or HALF_OPEN when tried is a genuine attempt, and its outcome is learned normally.
 *
 * ## Routing order, not skip/don't-skip
 *
 * Every call ranks *all* tiers by their current UCB index and tries them in that full order —
 * there is no separate skip decision. A tier that looks dead still gets a `UNEXPLORED_PRIORITY`-
 * or bonus-driven turn once its exploration term grows large enough, which is what guarantees
 * eventual recovery detection without a hand-rolled retry timer.
 *
 * ## Cancellation (issue #98)
 *
 * `getScoreCancellable` tries tiers in the same bandit-ranked order as
 * `route`, but a cancellation during any tier's attempt aborts the whole
 * chain immediately — it is not treated as that tier merely failing, so it
 * never falls through to the next tier, and it is not fed into the bandit
 * as learning evidence either way (a caller changing its mind isn't
 * evidence about the tier's health). A tier that itself implements
 * `CancellableRiskOracle` has its own underlying request actually aborted;
 * a tier that doesn't still lets the caller bail out immediately without
 * waiting for it, exactly like `CircuitBreakerOracle`'s CLOSED path.
